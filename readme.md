Because I honestly couldn't think of a better name for this. Well, that's the problem it's trying to solve, so ` ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ `

Anyway. This is a kludged-together repo of different experimental scripts for generating random but sensible project names.
As of now, I'm working on it in Python. Will likely take up JS or something in the future, or I'll use it as a testbed for
whatever language I'm trying to learn at a given point.

So, yeah!

Not sure I'm a fan of the ML random generator thingy I did, but that's honestly mostly because I have no memory of how I made that or what tutorial I followed. I suppose that's a hard earned lesson for me, to keep notes on these free-wheeling learning projects of mine.

The other two do seem to work in their own funny ways, but there's obviously much room for growth. So, yeah. Let's see.
