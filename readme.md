Because I honestly couldn't think of a better name for this. Well, that's the problem it's trying to solve, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Anyway. This is a kludged-together repo of different experimental scripts for generating random but sensible project names.
As of now, I'm working on it in Python. Will likely take up JS or something in the future, or I'll use it as a testbed for
whatever language I'm trying to learn at a given point.

So, yeah!
